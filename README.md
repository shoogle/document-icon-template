document-icon-template
======================

A "folded page" vector image template for creating document icons.

![Blank document icon][icon]

[icon]: document-icon-template.svg "Document Icon Template SVG"

## Instructions

When adding a logo or design to the icon, make sure your design goes above the
page background (obviously!) but below the foreground fold/curl and shadow.

### Text editors

For best results, edit the SVG code in a text editor rather than using a
graphical tool. This is the easiest way to see what changes you have made
from the original file, and ensures that code comments and indentation are
preserved. This is required if you want to contribute your changes back to
the upstream project.

### Inkscape

If you prefer to use a graphical tool, [Inkscape] is a popular vector graphics
editor which is free and open source.
